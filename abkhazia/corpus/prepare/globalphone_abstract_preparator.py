    The GlobalPhone corpus developed in collaboration with the
    Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) was designed to provide
    read speech data for the development and evaluation of large
    continuous speech recognition systems in the most widespread
    languages of the world.

    In each language about 100 sentences were read from each of the
    100 speakers. The read articles cover national and international
    political news as well as economic news. The speech is available
    in 16bit, 16kHz mono quality. Speaker information like age,
    gender, occupation, etc. as well as information about the
    recording setup complement the database.'''
