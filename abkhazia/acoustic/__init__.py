"""Provides classes for training acoustic models with Kaldi

Four types of acoustic models, of increasing complexity, are
implemented. Running model `n` needs `n-1` to be computed.

(0- Features)
1- Monophone GMM
2- Triphone speaker independent HMM-GMM
3- Triphone speaker adapted HMM-GMM
4- Triphone HMM-DNN

Each model is implemented as a child class of AcousticModelBase, which
is a wrapper to a standard Kaldi recipe in egs/wsj/s5/steps. Each
class forward the parameters of the Kaldi scripts it relies on in an
`options` attribute.

Exemple:
--------

Compute a monophone model with custom parameters

.. python

    am_mono = Monophone(corpus, lm_dir, feats_dir, output_dir)
    am_mono.set_option('num-iterations', 4)
    am_mono.set_option('total-gaussians', 100)
    am_mono.set_option('realign-iterations', [1, 2, 3])
    am_mono.compute()

Access to the list of available options

.. python

   am_tri = Triphone(corpus, lm_dir, am_mono_dir, am_tri_dir)
   for name, entry in am_mono.options.iteritems():
       print name, entry.value, entry.help, entry.default, entry.type
