        redirect the output to stdout, but you can redirect to a

        stdout=open(os.devnull, 'w').write to ignore the command
        output.

    stdin : standard input redirection, can be a file or any readable
        stream.

    cwd : current working directory for executing the command

    env : current environment for executing the command

    returncode : expected return code of the command

    Returns silently if the command returned with `returncode`, else
