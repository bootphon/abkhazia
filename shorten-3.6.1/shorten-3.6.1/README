shorten - fast compression for waveform files


Installation
------------

Instructions on how to build and install shorten are contained in the INSTALL
file.  Be sure to read it, especially if you have any problems, as it will
contain important notes related to building and installing.  However, for most
people this process will be as simple as:

% ./configure
% make                      (or gmake, if your make is not GNU - see INSTALL)
% make check                (IMPORTANT - please do not skip this step!  **)
% su -c "make install"      (or install-strip, where strip is supported)


** If you get an error here, please contact Jason Jordan <shnutils@freeshell.org>.
   Please paste the output of 'make check' into your email, and be prepared to
   run some additional tests for me if needed.  :-)


Documentation
-------------

A mostly-complete description of shorten and its command-line arguments are
contained in the man page ("man shorten").

To see what changes were made since previous releases, consult the ChangeLog
file.
