# Abkhazia

**Online documentation can be found [here](https://abkhazia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**

The Abkhazia project makes it easy to obtain simple baselines for
supervised ASR (using [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org)) and ABX tasks
(using [ABXpy](https://github.com/bootphon/ABXpy)) on the large corpora
of speech recordings typically used in speech engineering, linguistics
or cognitive science research.
