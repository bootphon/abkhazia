# Abkhazia

### See Online documentation https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/abkhazia

The Abkhazia project makes it easy to obtain simple baselines for
supervised ASR (using [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org)) and ABX tasks
(using [ABXpy](https://github.com/bootphon/ABXpy)) on the large corpora
of speech recordings typically used in speech engineering, linguistics
or cognitive science research.

**Abkhazia requires python>=3.6 instead. The last version compatible with
python2 is
[abkhazia-0.3.1](https://github.com/bootphon/abkhazia/releases/tag/v0.3.1)**
